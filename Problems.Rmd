```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Problem 3

Write code that will place the numbers 1 to 100 separately into a variable using for loop. Then, again using the seq function.

```{r}
One2Hundred <- c()
for (i in 1:100){
One2Hundred[i] <- i
}
One2seq <- seq(1,100)
```

### Problem 4

Find the sum of all the integer numbers from 1 to 100

With sum() function

```{r}
Summate <- sum(One2Hundred)
```

With a loop

```{r}
SummateLoop <- 0L
for (i in 1:100) {
SummateLoop = SummateLoop + i
}
```
